Steve Brudz is an engineer, writer, and artist.  He currently works as a software consultant helping clients and their product teams untangle knotty technical problems.  He has been developing software professionally since 1997 and is skilled with a variety of languages and technology stacks.  Currently, he prefers Ruby for back-end work, Terraform for infrastructure, and JavaScript or TypeScript for front-end work.

Inspired by John Scalzi's call to [bring back the artisan web](https://whatever.scalzi.com/2022/11/25/how-to-weave-the-artisan-web/), this site is a home for Steve's writing and experiments.
