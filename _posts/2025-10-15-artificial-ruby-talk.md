Phoenix's latest release introduced self‑healing tests. After you sign off on an Everflame report, Phoenix automatically prunes stale tests and replaces them with new ones based on your updated code. This talk demonstrates how self‑healing works, how it changes the way we think about test maintenance, and how Everflame reports keep your team in the loop. If you’ve ever skipped writing tests to hit a deadline, come see how Phoenix gives you confidence without the maintenance burden.
